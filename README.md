Trillek Virtual Computer Lib
============================

Using these [specs](https://github.com/trillek-team/trillek-computer)

The design of the Virtual Computer allows to plug and use different CPUs. Actually are the TR3200 and the DCPU-16N. 

This repo contains of the Trillek Virtual Computer lib and some extra tools, including a toy emulator build over the lib.

COMPILING
---------
We are using CMake and C++ 11 (Vs2013/4 , G++ >= 4.7, LLVM). So if you are in GNU/Linux you could compile with this :

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

By default it will generate a dynamic library and compile tools and tests.

If you wish to compile a static lib, then you should use `cmake -DBUILD_STATIC_VCOMPUTER=True ..`
** This is required to build in MSVC **

If you not wish to compile the tools, then you should use `cmake -DBUILD_TOOLS_VCOMPUTER=False ..`

If you not wish to compile the tests, then you should use `cmake -DBUILD_TESTS_VCOMPUTER=False ..`

Plus you can control if you wish release or debug building using `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` or `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` flag in cmake.

In windows, you should add the "-g" parameter with the apropiated generator for VS2013 (you can get the list running cmake --help), or you can use the CMake GUI. With this, you can generate VS2013/4 project/solution files that you can open and compile.

### EMSCRIPTEN
Emscripten compilation has not been rewrite/checked yet with the new version. Expect it to fail.

  cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/Platform/Emscripten.cmake -DEMSCRIPTEN_ROOT_PATH=/usr/bin/ ..
  make
  
Include vm_wrap.js inside a HTML page or other javascript. A example webpage will be copied to the build dir. Also, you can
try it in [cpu.zardoz.es](http://cpu.zardoz.es)

NOTE : Depending how you installed Emscripten, you will need to change the -DEMSCRIPTEN_ROOT_PATH value.

WHAT IT DOES ACTUALLY
------------------
### Tools

#### vm

Is a program that uses the Trillek Virtual Computer lib to run a TR3200 emulation. Can run in step mode or in "run mode" where it executes all the program without stopping. Needs C++ 11 *std::chrono compilance* for measuring times; **GLFW3 + GLM + OpenGL 3.2** is needed if you desire to see the virtual screen.

- Can load a little endian binary file with a ROM image with a max size of 32KiB.
- Step mode, has an on-line disassembler. Each time that you press enter or 's' or 'S'
  keys, one instruction is executed, and the status of registers and stack, is
  shown. '**q**' ends the execution. '**r**' switch to Run mode
- Run mode, It tries to enforce CPU Clock speed. Only stops by doing '**Ctrl+C**' or closing the virtual screen window, or when finds a breakpoint. 

It accepts this parameters:
```
Virtual Computer toy Emulator

Usage:
        ./vm -r romfile [other parameters]

Parameters:
        -r file or --rom file : RAW binary file for the ROM 32 KiB
        -d file or --disk file : Disk file
        -c val or --cpu val : Sets the CPU to use, from "tr3200" or "dcpu-16n"
        -m val or --disk val : How many RAM have the computer in KiB. Must be > 128 and < 1024. Will be round to a multiple of 128
        --clock val : CPU clock speed in Khz. Must be 100, 250, 500 or 1000.
        -b val : Inserts a breakpoint at address val (could be hexadecimal or decimal).
        -h or --help : Shows this help
```

#### pbm2font

Is a small tool that can generate a hexadecimal representation of a user font for the TDA display card. Uses as source image, a b&w ASCII **pbm** file (Gimp can generate it). It expects that the image have a width and height multiple of 8, as it divides the image in cells of 8x8 pixels each being a glyph of the font.

### Tests

#### benchmark

Is a program that runs a quick and dirty benchmark to measure the performance of the Trillek Virtual Computer lib. Needs C++ 11 *std::chrono compilance* for measuring times.

- Can load a list of little endian binary files as ROMs for each Virtual Computer.
- Aceepts a final optional parameter with the number of CPUs to run, if not especified, then will be 1000.
- Each Virtual Computer have the same set of devices plugged and the same amount of RAM
- Executes a random number of cycles before begin the benchmark to make more realistic.
- Runs CPUs at different clock speeds, aroung 70% are at 100KHz, 20% at 200KHz, 5% at 500KHz and 1% at 1Mhz.
- Tries to execute Virtual Computers with the TR3200 CPUs in a single thread at what your computer can give. It does not enforce a particular speed, but it gives information of the emulation speed. To know how many Virtual Computer you can run in your computer, tune the number of CPUs to get a speed around 110%, and these value will be the number of CPUs adecuate for your machine.
- Only stops by doing 'Ctrl+C'.
- Try it with with **Release** compile mode, there is an apreciable difference.

#### unit test

If before calling CMake, you setup a enviroment variable called "GTEST_ROOT" with the path to GTest suite, then the unit tests could be compiled and will generate an executable file "unit_test". This allow to check if some basic code gets broken if someone try to edit the source code. Are far of being a exaustive tests, but it's far better that nothing.

To set a enviroment variable on GNU/Linux (and Mac):

    export GTEST_ROOT=...

If you are using fish shell :

    set -x GTEST_ROOT /usr/src/gtest/
  
In windows, you should do that in Control Panel.

HOW I CAN CREATE PROGRAMS ?
---------------------------
Actually you can use <a href="https://github.com/Meisaka/WaveAsm" target="_blank">Meisaka's WaveAsm</a> to generate TR3200 machine code.

ADJUNCT TR3200 ASM PROGRAMS
--------------------------
There are some TR3200 ASM programs, source code and binary files, in /asm directory. Specifically :

- hello.asm : Hello world
- test.asm : Some tests of TR3200 CPU compliance.
- type1.asm : Basic typing program
- hwn.asm : List how many devices are pluged and what are.
- clock.asm : Basic example of system clock using Timer0


IMPLEMENTED DEVICES
-------------------

- TDA graphics card
- Generic Wester/Latin keyboard
- Dummy device (Used only to test stuff)

TODO
----

- Integrated stuff of the mother board (RTC, RNG, NVRAM)
- Check interrupts
- Implement Floppy drive
- DCPU-16N cpu (Actually being implemented)
